React Coding Task
Hello,

Welcome to OLIO's technical task. For this task we'd like you to create a basic react based app (that we could install and try). This isn't designed to take a huge amount of your time and we're more interested to see what your areas of focus are and what you consider to be good engineering practices rather than the final result.

As a guide we believe that good engineering practices include:

Well named variables/methods/functions
Consistent syntax
Well thought out code
(At least) basic documentation
Tests
Thoughtful commits
Your audience is someone who has never run/used react previously, but would like to get the app built and working in a browser.

Firstly, the list of articles is stored here, https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/olio-staging-images/developer/test-articles-v4.json, and you'll need to pull this from the server on load (as it may change).

It would be great if you could display the list of articles on the page, and possibly show a map with some interaction to link it to a more detailed version of the article itself.

Lastly, we'd like to be able to flag an article as 'seen' or 'viewed', so when the user interacts with the article in some way it gets marked as such'. I'll leave you to decide what the interaction should be.

Once you are done please email tech-careers@olioex.com with the code, or a link to the code (if its on github/gitlab/etc please ensure the repository is public). Provided this stage is successful we'll organise a follow up technical interview to discuss what you submitted. Also if you haven't previously used the app it would be a good idea to have given it a go before your interview (bonus points for organising a collection ðŸ˜€).

If you have any questions please feel free to email us at any time.

Cheers, OLIO Tech Team
