# Points of Improvement and Comments

- As there was no recent information I decided to leave the date exposed instead of label `just added`
- I'm having trouble getting it to run Android Studio on my Macbook and I ended up doing tests only using xCode.
- In order not to take too long to develop, I ended up choosing to focus on the development of the App on iOS.
- The Request button does not go to another screen, I prefer to focus on developing the main screens based on API data.
- I would improve the map information by getting the grouped item numbers and also the Icon.
- Should start the unit tests as TDD, but I ended up leaving it for the end. These made it more complex to resolve the failures.
- Could make an accessible layout focused on WCAG if it was the project.
- Isolate environment variables, such as API URL using env.
- I ended up separating the tests only into components to make testing the rendering simpler than testing large screens. It also contributes to maintainability and to discover possible failitures.
- As I tried to make the app work fast, I ended up not focusing so much on the layout colors that should be gray and not white. I chose to focus on the functionalities working as correctly as possible, according to the limited time.
- The `allergy` link does not redirect to a WebView or external link. I just put it as a layout item.
- The folder structure of screen components could be modified according to domain(screen), in this case I chose to build reusable components.
- I decided at the last minute to make a reusable component with ProductCard to make it easier instead of ["Rule of Three" (code duplication)](https://wou.edu/las/cs/csclasses/cs161/Lectures/rulesofthumb.html)
- Some items on the page could be better styled, due to the time limit I ended up not focusing on this part, like BottomTabs, for example.
- The colour codes could have been part of a theme file instead of being scattered throughout the code and hardcoded.
- The pink flags over the product photos are representing a visited product.
